- Tooling Support with IntelliSense
- Modules, Decorators, Classes
- Compiles Into Clean JS Code

# Front-End Wizard
- Familiar with a popular frontend framework
- Build advanced front-end apps/interfaces
- Smooth front-end workflow
- Interact with backend APIs and data
- Manage application and component level state
- Bonus: Serve side rendering / Static site generation

# Server-Side Language (Choose One)
To be a fullstack or backend developer, you will need to learn a server-side programming language / technology

- Node.js

- Must be HTTPS
- Reliable, fast and engaging

# JAMstack
"JavaScript, APIs & Markup" is a modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup

- High performance, generated at deploy time
- Cheaper and easy to scale
- Easy to host(Netlify)

# Serverless Architecture
Server operations without actually needing your own server

# API-First Design
With more and more loT (internet of things) expect to see api-focused design

- Traditonally we start with the UI and then move to the backend with a strict connection to the wep app
- With API-first design, you start with the appropriate APIs and then build products on top of it

# Machine Learning / AI & The Web
Machine learning & AI are growing in all areas of technology and can be useful in web apps / services

- Alternative to conventional data mining
- Remove security threats
- Machine learning APIs
- Study user behavior
- Much more...

# Speech Recognition
Speech recognition is a major trend in technology. In 2020, expect to see more of this in web apps, especially with search
